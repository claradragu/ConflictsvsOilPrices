# ConflictsvsOilPrices
QM2 notebook and datasets
The objective is to prove causality between Middle Eastern conflicts and global oil prices. This is achieved through an initial qualitative selection of the conflicts used as Event studies. Their directional relationship with oil is then determined through the application of specific tools such as Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT) and Difference in differences (DID).
